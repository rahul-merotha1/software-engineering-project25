# NITT Examination Portal System

## Introduction
The NITT Examination Portal is a comprehensive web-based application designed to streamline the examination process for National Institute of Technology, Trichy (NITT). This system provides three distinct interfaces catering to administrators, teachers, and students, facilitating a complete digital examination ecosystem. Built with modern web technologies, the portal ensures secure, efficient, and user-friendly management of all examination-related activities.

## Theoretical Framework

### System Overview
The examination portal operates on a role-based access control (RBAC) model with the following hierarchy:

1. **Administrators**: Have supreme control over the system
2. **Teachers**: Can create and manage examinations
3. **Students**: Can take examinations and view results

### Core Concepts Implemented
- **Digital Examination Management**: Complete lifecycle from question creation to result publication
- **Time-bound Testing**: Strict time enforcement for fair examinations
- **Automated Evaluation**: Immediate result calculation for objective questions
- **Performance Analytics**: Detailed insights for both students and faculty
- **Secure Access Control**: Role-based authentication for all operations
